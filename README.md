## Overview

TruthLens is a production-ready, full-stack artificial intelligence application designed to detect fake news articles with high accuracy. The system combines advanced natural language processing, explainable AI techniques, and large language models to provide not only predictions but also human-readable explanations of why content is classified as fake or real.

### Key Capabilities

- **High Accuracy**: 99.3% accuracy on test datasets using fine-tuned RoBERTa model
- **Explainable AI**: SHAP-based word importance analysis to highlight influential terms
- **Natural Language Explanations**: Gemini LLM-generated educational explanations for end users
- **Real-time Processing**: Complete analysis in approximately 98 seconds
- **Modern Web Interface**: Professional, responsive frontend with smooth animations
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring

## Features

### Core Functionality

1. **Text-based Detection**
   - Analyzes article title and content
   - Provides confidence scores for both fake and real classifications
   - Returns probability distributions

2. **Explainable AI (XAI)**
   - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis
   - Identifies top 15 influential words
   - Color-coded word importance visualization
   - Separate indicators for fake and real signals

3. **LLM-powered Explanations**
   - Human-readable explanations generated by Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
   - Educational tone with actionable tips for users
   - Context-aware analysis of word patterns

4. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - Request tracking with unique IDs
   - Performance metrics (processing time per component)
   - DynamoDB integration for prediction history (optional)

### User Interface Features

- Sample article templates (fake and real examples)
- Real-time character counter
- Form validation
- Loading states with progress indication
- Animated result display
- Filterable word highlights (All/Fake/Real tabs)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Error state handling

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

**Terminal 1 - Start Backend:**

cd backend
source ../venv/bin/activate # Activate virtual environment
python -m app.main


**Terminal 2 - Start Frontend:**

cd frontend
http-server -p 5500 --cors

### Access Application

- **Frontend**: http://172.21.16.74:5500 (WSL) or http://localhost:5500
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger UI)

### Testing

1. Open frontend in browser
2. Click "Fake News Example" or "Real News Example"
3. Click "Analyze Article"
4. Wait approximately 1.5 minutes for results
5. Review prediction, explanation, and word highlights

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Backend fails to start
**Solution**: Check MODEL_PATH in .env points to correct directory

**Issue**: Frontend timeout
**Solution**: Increase REQUEST_TIMEOUT in frontend/config.js

**Issue**: CORS errors
**Solution**: Verify backend CORS settings allow frontend origin

**Issue**: DynamoDB errors
**Solution**: Configure AWS credentials or ignore (logging is optional)
